# About
Internet Creeps is a collection of 222 story-based NFTs on the Internet Computer. Each holder will have the option to create a short story about their NFT with a chance at winning a large prize. Featuring captivating generative art and 1:1 characters, each NFT also doubles as exclusive access to future collections. These collections will be released semi-annually to holders only. Giving back is very important to us, which is why 10% of all proceeds go to [MAPS](https://maps.org) in order to fund research on the use of psychedelics for mental health. Join the Internet Creep family and be a part of our exciting journey through the metaverse!
